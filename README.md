The goal is to take the code from yesterday’s livecode, lewagon/food-delivery@livecode-day-one and implement the “Sign in” feature.

1. First you’ll need to implement the Employee model 
2. Then implement the EmployeeRepository
3. Then add a SessionsController to implement the sign_in
4. Update the router to display a different menu based on the signed in guy
